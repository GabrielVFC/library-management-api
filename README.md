# Library Management System (Relational Database Design) 📚

A comprehensive database architecture designed to manage the core operations of a library. This project focuses on the relational mapping between authors, books, customers, and the transactional logic of loans.



### 🚀 Key Technical Features

* **Relational Schema (DDL)**: Implemented a robust structure using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints to link books to authors and loans to both customers and inventory.
* **Full CRUD Implementation**: Demonstrates mastery over the complete data lifecycle, including complex `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations.
* **Data Integrity**: Enforces business rules through `UNIQUE` constraints (e.g., ISBN and CPF) to prevent data duplication.
* **Organized Scripting**: Separation of concerns with dedicated SQL files for schema creation, data insertion, updates, and deletions.

### 🛠 SQL Mastery Demonstrated

- **Transactional Logic**: Designing schemas that track real-world events like book loans and return deadlines.
- **Schema Evolution**: Using `UPDATE` commands to maintain accurate and up-to-date records for clients and inventory.
- **Autoincrement Management**: Utilizing Primary Keys effectively to ensure unique identification across all entities.

### 💻 Tech Stack
- **Database Engine:** SQLite
- **Languages:** SQL (DDL, DML)
- **Concepts:** Relational Integrity, CRUD Lifecycle, Transaction Management.

*Note: This project highlights my ability to design relational systems for transactional management. I am currently applying these database foundations to Go (Golang) back-end services with PostgreSQL and Docker.*
